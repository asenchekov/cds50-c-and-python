        <p>My employment history until now was in the hospitality work area as a chef, I hope that doesn't confuse you. I have a passion for coding since I was young, used to play around with MS-DOS, QBASIC and PASCAL but took a different path and profession.</p>
        <p>I've been always the guy helping my friends fixing their computers and reinstalling operating systems and such. Recently decided to make a change and started studying for a web developer, with the dream of making it my full-time job. </p>
        <p>Since I started learning to code I keep telling myself that I should've started a long time ago. I've achieved certification for a Beginner Web Developer and CIW certification for Advanced HTML5 and CSS3 specialist, and recently started a Certification program for Introduction to Computer Science at HarvardX by EdX platform. Along with these lessons I have few free courses finished at codecademy.com for Javascript and React.js. </p>
        <p> At my current position I'm working on Meteor.js framework based project. Gaining experience writing ES6 style code, working with MongoDB and various tools for it. Also learned to make XMLHttpRequest and debug it with ngrok. </p>
